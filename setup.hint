ldesc: "Do is an intelligent launcher tool that makes performing common 
tasks on your computer simple and efficient. Do not only allows you to 
search for items in your desktop environment (e.g. applications, 
contacts, bookmarks, files, music), it also allows you to specify 
actions to perform on search results (e.g. run, open, email, chat, 
play)."
